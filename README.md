# VendingMachine

This is a real world vending machine Java console app with Item, Main and VendingMachine classes plus VendingMachineImplementation Interface.
I created Item class with its properties, constructor and required getters.
Then created Interface for all required functionality for app.
Then implemented VendingMachine class initialized Items and added each item also implemented all methods from Interface since I implemented it.
